# imapBruteForce/Password Spraying
This python script can be used to brute force imap logins where account lockout has not been turned off or disabled for imap logins.

It may also be used as a password spraying script.


This script is just designed to be a proof of concept and will download and print the first email in the mailbox within the python shell.

It has not (yet) been optimized for threading.
